***Features***

check the features.md in the docs folder and start on the next incomplete task. Before implementing please think hard and make a detailed step by step plan for doing so making sure to integrate it well into the existing application architecture as well as UI and styling using the theme variables everywhere it makes sense to. the plan should be added to a file in the docs folder. When the plan is complete start on the first task in the plan.

update the features.md and claude.md files making sure to note if the task was not completed all the way and where to find the plan file for it if there is one. always leave a section at the top of the features.md file for me to add more features. if a feature has been completed then only leave the name of the feature marked completed and a 1 line description and remove the plan file. then commit and push the changes.

***Bugs***

check the bugs.md in the docs folder and start on the next incomplete task. Before implementing please think hard and make a detailed step by step plan for doing so making sure to integrate it well into the existing application architecture as well as UI and styling using the theme variables everywhere it makes sense to. the plan should be added to a file in the docs folder.

update the bugs.md and claude.md files making sure to note if the task was not completed all the way and where to find the plan file for it if there is one. always leave a section at the top of the bugs.md file for me to add more bugs. if a bug has been completely fixed then only leave the name of the bug marked fixed and a 1 or 2 line description of the fix and remove the plan file. then commit and push the changes.



Cursor

***Features***

Review docs/features.md and select the next incomplete task. Create a detailed implementation plan before coding:
1. Document a step-by-step approach for completing the task, making sure to cover edge cases.
2. Ensure seamless integration with the existing application architecture, UI, and styling patterns
3. Use theme variables throughout the implementation
4. Use proper TypeScript typing everywhere—never use any as a type
5. Save the finalized plan to the docs/ folder
Once the plan is complete and reviewed, implement the first task from the plan.
then
Update features.md, .cursor/rules files, and architecture doc with the following rules:
1. Maintain a "New Features" section at the top of features.md for easy addition of new ideas
2. For incomplete tasks: mark status, note what remains unfinished, and reference the plan file location
3. For completed features: replace full entry with feature name + "[COMPLETED]" label + 1 line description, then delete the associated plan file
4. If the feature was part of the Unified Architecture: mark the relevant implementation phase as complete in unified-debt-bill-credit-card-architecture.md
5. Add feature to manual-testing-checklist.md 
6. Commit and push all changes

***Bugs***

Review docs/bugs.md and select the next incomplete task. Create a detailed implementation plan before coding:
1. Document a step-by-step approach for completing the task
2. Ensure seamless integration with the existing application architecture, UI, and styling patterns
3. Use theme variables throughout the implementation
4. Use proper TypeScript typing everywhere—never use any as a type
5. Save the finalized plan to the docs/ folder

then
Update bugs.md and .cursor/rules files with the following rules:
1. Maintain a "New Bugs" section at the top of bugs.md for easy addition of new issues
2. For incomplete tasks: mark status, note what remains unfinished, and reference the plan file location
3. For completed bugs: replace full entry with bug name + "[FIXED]" label + 1-2 line description of the fix, then delete the associated plan file
4. Commit and push all changes

***Manual Testing***

Review docs/manual-testing-checklist.md and systematically test the application using the browser:
1. Start with the next untested section in the checklist
2. Navigate to the relevant page and test each item using browser tools
3. For each test case:
   - Mark [x] if the test passes
   - Mark [!] if there's an issue and add a brief note
   - Leave [ ] if not yet tested
4. If you find a bug, document it in docs/bugs.md with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
5. After completing a section, update the checklist with test date and results
6. Continue to the next section until testing is complete or time runs out

Focus on functional correctness, UI/UX issues, and edge cases. Use browser dev tools to monitor console errors and network requests during testing.

***Retest Fixed Bugs***

Review docs/manual-testing-checklist.md and retest items that previously failed but have since been fixed:
1. Search the checklist for items marked with [!] (failed tests)
2. Cross-reference with docs/bugs.md to verify the associated bug has been marked as fixed
3. For each fixed bug, retest the corresponding checklist item using browser tools:
   - If the test now passes: change [!] to [x] and remove or update the failure note
   - If the test still fails: keep [!] and update the note with current behavior
   - If the bug fix introduced new issues: document in bugs.md
4. Update the "Last Tested" date for any retested sections
5. Continue until all [!] items with fixed bugs have been retested

Focus on verifying the fix works correctly and hasn't caused regressions. Use browser dev tools to confirm no new console errors or failed network requests.
