check the bugs.md in the docs folder and start on the next incomplete task. Before implementing please think hard and make a detailed step by step plan for doing so making sure to integrate it well into the existing application architecture as well as UI and styling using the theme variables everywhere it makes sense to. the plan should be added to a file in the docs folder. When the plan is complete start on the first task in the plan.

update the bugs.md and claude.md files making sure to note if the task was not completed all the way and where to find the plan file for it if there is one. then commit and push the changes.
