## Sales Tax Boolean Refactor (COMPLETE) ✅
**Status:** All features complete including dashboard update ✅
**Date:** 2025-11-10
**Plan Documents:**
- `docs/sales-tax-boolean-refactor-plan.md` (Original core refactor)
- `docs/sales-tax-dashboard-boolean-update-plan.md` (Dashboard update)

### Objective
Simplify sales tax tracking from a complex rate-based system to a simple boolean flag (yes/no) system for better UX and maintainability.

### Completed ✅

**Database Changes:**
- ✅ Migration 0023: Added `isSalesTaxable` boolean field to transactions table
- ✅ Added indexes for efficient sales tax queries
- ✅ Database migration applied successfully

**Transaction Form UI:**
- ✅ Removed complex tax rate selector and calculation display
- ✅ Simplified to single checkbox for income transactions
- ✅ Removed unnecessary state variables and API calls
- ✅ Clean, minimal interface

**Rules System:**
- ✅ Simplified `set_sales_tax` action - no configuration needed
- ✅ Updated `lib/rules/types.ts` - SalesTaxConfig simplified
- ✅ Updated `lib/rules/actions-executor.ts` - boolean flag only
- ✅ Updated `lib/rules/sales-tax-action-handler.ts` - validation simplified

**Rule Builder UI:**
- ✅ Removed tax rate selector from action configuration
- ✅ Simplified to informational text only
- ✅ Removed tax categories state and API fetching
- ✅ Full theme integration maintained

**Transaction API:**
- ✅ Updated POST /api/transactions to accept `isSalesTaxable` boolean
- ✅ Applied to income transactions (manual + rule-based)
- ✅ Removed deprecated sales tax record creation code
- ✅ Clean implementation with proper type safety

**Sales Tax Dashboard (NEW - 2025-11-10):**
- ✅ Updated `lib/sales-tax/sales-tax-utils.ts` to query transactions table with `isSalesTaxable` boolean
- ✅ Added `getUserSalesTaxRate()` and `updateUserSalesTaxRate()` helper functions
- ✅ Created `/api/sales-tax/settings` endpoint (GET + POST) for household-level tax rate configuration
- ✅ Added tax rate configuration UI card with edit mode, validation, and save functionality
- ✅ Updated no data state with instructions for boolean system workflow
- ✅ Updated quarterly filing cards to show "(configured)" label next to tax rate
- ✅ Converted all hardcoded colors to theme CSS variables (Dark Mode + Dark Pink Theme support)
- ✅ Chart colors updated to use semantic variables (income, success, warning, error, transfer)
- ✅ Dashboard now applies configured tax rate at reporting time (one-time setup)

**TypeScript & Build:**
- ✅ Updated all type definitions (AppliedAction, ActionExecutionContext, TransactionMutations)
- ✅ Production build successful with zero errors
- ✅ All 43 pages compiled successfully

### Architecture

**Data Flow:**
1. User configures sales tax rate once at household level (e.g., 8.5%)
2. Income transactions marked with `isSalesTaxable` checkbox (or via rules)
3. Dashboard queries transactions WHERE `isSalesTaxable = true` AND `type = 'income'`
4. Tax amount calculated at reporting time: `taxableAmount × configuredRate`
5. Quarterly reports show totals with applied rate

**Key Benefits:**
- **Simpler UX:** Just check a box when creating income, set rate once
- **Cleaner Code:** Removed ~500+ lines of complex tax calculation logic
- **Better Performance:** No API calls during transaction creation
- **Flexible Reporting:** Change rate without updating old transactions
- **Consistent:** Aligns with how tax deductions work (boolean flag)
- **Production Ready:** All functionality fully operational

### Files Modified (20 files total)

**Core Refactor (16 files):**
- Database: schema.ts + migration 0023
- Transaction Form: transaction-form.tsx (~150 lines simplified)
- Rules: types.ts, actions-executor.ts, sales-tax-action-handler.ts
- Rule Builder: rule-builder.tsx (~100 lines simplified)
- API: transactions/route.ts
- Types: Multiple interface updates for type safety

**Dashboard Update (4 new/modified files):**
- `lib/sales-tax/sales-tax-utils.ts` (~200 lines modified, 2 new functions)
- `app/api/sales-tax/settings/route.ts` (~120 lines NEW)
- `app/dashboard/sales-tax/page.tsx` (~400 lines modified - config UI, theme colors, updated instructions)
- `docs/sales-tax-dashboard-boolean-update-plan.md` (NEW - detailed implementation plan)

**Build Status:** ✅ Production build successful, zero TypeScript errors

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. sales tax rule should allow user to set transactions to true or false. right now it only allows setting to true.
