# Features to implement
1. Add a small card at the top of the dashboard to show goals.
2. for income add a field for frequency and use it for tracking in the budget. Right now it calculates the daily average and that is very inaccurate if you get paid biweekly or monthly. It should still have an option for variable frequency and that one should still calculate the daily average.
