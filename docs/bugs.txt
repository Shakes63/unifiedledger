COMPLETED BUGS:
✅ 1. the category and accounts dropdown on the bill form are not connected to the categories and accounts
✅ 2. when creating a new transaction the default date should be today
✅ 3. There should be a way to mark an account as being a Business Account and that should trigger the sales tax tracking for that account.
✅ 4. If there are multiple business accounts the sales tax should be tracked separately.
✅ 5. Everywhere that you can add a category or tag there should be an option to create them inline.
✅ 6. there should be some padding in between the sidebar and the page content. The dashboard is a good example of the amount of padding it should have. Check all of the pages and ensure the padding is like the dashboard page.
✅ 7. When trying to create an account the submit button is not creating the account.

PENDING BUGS:
8. the dropdowns across the app are completely transparent, turn up the opacity so that they can be read easier.

10. the transaction form is doubled up there should only be one.
11. make the cards on the categories page more compact.
