COMPLETED BUGS:
✅ 1. the category and accounts dropdown on the bill form are not connected to the categories and accounts
✅ 2. when creating a new transaction the default date should be today
✅ 3. There should be a way to mark an account as being a Business Account and that should trigger the sales tax tracking for that account.
✅ 4. If there are multiple business accounts the sales tax should be tracked separately.
✅ 5. Everywhere that you can add a category or tag there should be an option to create them inline.
✅ 6. there should be some padding in between the sidebar and the page content. The dashboard is a good example of the amount of padding it should have. Check all of the pages and ensure the padding is like the dashboard page.
✅ 7. When trying to create an account the submit button is not creating the account.
✅ 8. the dropdowns across the app are completely transparent, turn up the opacity so that they can be read easier.
✅ 9. when creating a transaction there should only be a transfer type instead of transfer in and transfer out. If Transfer is selected it should show a From Account and To Account dropdowns.
✅ 10. the transaction form is doubled up there should only be one.
✅ 11. make the cards on the categories page more compact.
✅ 12. Account creation was failing with 500 error - fixed missing is_business_account database column
✅ 13. Sidebar dashboard was highlighted even when a different option was selected - fixed isActive() function
✅ 14. Transfer form showed duplicate "Account" labels - fixed by making AccountSelector label customizable
✅ 15. Category cards were too large - made them significantly smaller (p-2, reduced fonts, gap-2)
✅ 16. Categories couldn't be marked as tax deductible - added isTaxDeductible field and toggle UI
✅ 17. BillsWidget error "data.filter is not a function" - API returns {data: [...], total, limit, offset} but component expected array. Fixed by extracting data.data and handling both array and object responses
✅ 18. Added Merchant field to transactions with inline creation feature:
   - Added merchantId field to transactions table in schema
   - Created database migration 0005_add_merchant_id.sql
   - Enhanced /api/merchants/route.ts with POST endpoint for creating merchants
   - Created /api/merchants/[id]/route.ts for PUT (update) and DELETE operations
   - Created MerchantSelector component with inline creation (similar to CategorySelector)
   - Integrated MerchantSelector into TransactionForm (hidden for transfers)
   - Created full Merchants management page at /dashboard/merchants with list, edit, delete, create
   - Added "Merchants" link to sidebar in Tools section
   - Merchants support usage count tracking and are sorted by usage

✅ 19. Separated merchants and description fields:
   - Removed MerchantAutocomplete from description field
   - Description field is now plain Input component
   - Merchant field is selected via separate MerchantSelector component
   - Merchant suggestions no longer appear in description field

✅ 20. Fixed internal server error when selecting description from dropdown:

   - For transfers, shows "From Account → To Account" format
   - Added helper functions: getMerchantName, getAccountName, getTransactionDisplay
   - Transfer icon shows ArrowRightLeft in blue color
   - Reduced vertical space: p-4→p-2, space-y-3→space-y-2, removed type badge
   - Transactions now take up ~50% less vertical space

   - Root cause: merchantId field added to schema/form but not extracted in API endpoints
   - POST /api/transactions now extracts merchantId from request body
   - PUT /api/transactions/[id] now supports merchantId updates
   - Removed old auto-merchant creation logic (conflicted with new MerchantSelector)
   - Now only tracks merchant usage when merchantId is explicitly provided
   - Updated validation to check for merchantId in update checks

✅ 23. Fixed 500 error on GET /api/transactions - better-sqlite3 bindings issue:
   - Root cause: Native bindings for better-sqlite3 weren't built
   - Solution: Cleaned .next directory and reinstalled dependencies with pnpm
   - pnpm install --force triggered proper build of better-sqlite3 native bindings
   - API now responds with {"error":"Unauthorized"} (expected Clerk auth error)
   - Transactions page should now load properly when authenticated

✅ 24. Fixed 500 error on GET /api/transactions - missing merchant_id column:
   - Root cause: Database migration 0005_add_merchant_id.sql wasn't applied to sqlite.db
   - Error: SqliteError: no such column: "merchant_id"
   - Solution: Created migration script to apply pending migrations manually
   - Applied migration: 0005_add_merchant_id (added merchant_id column and index)
   - API now returns proper Unauthorized error (authentication working)
   - RecentTransactions widget should now load when user is authenticated

✅ 25. Fixed recent transactions not showing merchant information:
   - Root cause: RecentTransactions component wasn't fetching or displaying merchant data
   - Missing: merchantId in Transaction interface, merchants/accounts state, helper functions
   - Solution:
     - Added merchantId, transferId to Transaction interface
     - Added Merchant and Account interfaces
     - Added merchants and accounts state
     - Fetch merchants and accounts data in useEffect

✅ 26. Fixed transaction page params Promise error:
   - Error: "A param property was accessed directly with `params.id`. `params` is a Promise..."
   - Root cause: Next.js 16 made params a Promise in dynamic routes
   - Solution:
     - Changed params interface type from object to Promise<{id: string}>
     - Imported React
     - Used React.use(params) to unwrap the Promise
     - Updated transactionId prop to use resolvedParams.id
   - Transaction details page now loads without errors

✅ 27. Fixed household page showing owner with no name:
   - Root cause: When creating household and when accepting invitations, userName wasn't being fetched from Clerk
   - Solution:
     - Imported clerkClient from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
     - In /api/households/route.ts POST: Fetch user from Clerk, extract firstName+lastName or firstName or username
     - In /api/invitations/accept/route.ts POST: Same approach for invited members
     - Now passes proper userName to householdMembers when creating records
   - Household members now display with their full names instead of blank

✅ 28. Fixed TransactionDetails component bgColor undefined error:
   - Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'bgColor')" at line 159

     - Updated Transaction interface type to include 'transfer' alongside 'transfer_in'/'transfer_out'
     - Added 'transfer' entry to typeConfig object
     - Added fallback to typeConfig.expense if type not found: `typeConfig[transaction.type as keyof typeof typeConfig] || typeConfig.expense`
     - Updated sign calculation to handle 'transfer' type
   - Transaction details page now loads without errors for all transaction types

✅ 29. Fixed tax dashboard and sales tax pages throwing errors with no data:

   - Solution for Tax Dashboard:
     - Added hasData check (data.summary.byCategory.length > 0)
     - Added hasDeductions check for filtering tax-deductible items
     - Wrapped all content sections (metrics, charts, tables, tips) with conditional rendering
     - Added friendly empty state card with FileText icon
     - Shows helpful message: "No Tax Data Available" with instructions
   - Solution for Sales Tax Dashboard:
     - Added hasData check (data.quarters.length > 0)

   - Year selector still available to check other years
   - Updated files: app/dashboard/tax/page.tsx, app/dashboard/sales-tax/page.tsx

✅ 30. Updated transaction display layout to show merchant, description, and account:
   - Root cause: Transaction list showed only merchant OR description, not both
   - Solution:
     - Refactored getTransactionDisplay() to return object with merchant and description separately
     - New layout structure:
       * Merchant name (bold, white, top line) - if merchant exists
       * Description (gray text below merchant, or main text if no merchant)
       * Date and split indicator (gray text)
       * Amount (right side, green for income, white for expenses)
       * Account name (below amount, gray text with 100px max width)
     - Transfer transactions show "FromAccount → ToAccount" as description
     - When no merchant: description appears as bold main text
     - When merchant exists: merchant bold on top, description gray below
   - Updated file: app/dashboard/transactions/page.tsx
   - New display provides better context with both merchant and description visible

✅ 32. Removed transfers page and added account-based transaction filtering:
   - Part 1: Remove transfers page
     - Removed "Transfers" link from sidebar navigation (Financial section)
     - Removed ArrowRightLeft icon import (no longer used)
     - Transfers can now only be created via transaction form (type: "Transfer")
   - Part 2: Account-based transaction filtering
     - Added "View Transactions" button to AccountCard with ArrowRight icon
     - Button links to `/dashboard/transactions?accountId={accountId}`
     - Enhanced transactions page to accept accountId URL parameter
     - Auto-filters transactions by account when accountId is present in URL
     - Updated page header to show account name when filtered
       * "Account Name Transactions" instead of just "Transactions"
       * Subtitle shows "X transactions for this account"
     - Uses useSearchParams hook for URL parameter handling
     - Automatic search trigger when account filter is detected
   - Files updated:
     - components/accounts/account-card.tsx (added View Transactions button)

   - User experience:
     - Click account card → immediately see all transactions for that account
     - Transfer creation handled through standard transaction form
     - Cleaner navigation with one less menu item

✅ 33. Updated transaction type filters to use unified transfer type:
   - Root cause: Advanced search still showed "Transfer In" and "Transfer Out" filters
   - Solution:
     - Updated transactionTypes array in advanced-search.tsx
     - Replaced two separate transfer types with single "Transfer" option
     - Old: transfer_in (Transfer In), transfer_out (Transfer Out)
     - New: transfer (Transfer)
     - Matches the unified transfer type system implemented in bug #32
   - File updated: components/transactions/advanced-search.tsx (lines 75-79)
   - Result: Search filters now correctly align with current transaction type system

✅ 34. Fixed bills API 500 Internal Server Error:
   - Root cause: Invalid SQL query in GET /api/bills endpoint
   - Issue: Query was trying to select `upcomingInstance: billInstances` but billInstances was never joined to the query
   - This caused a SQL error when the query executed
   - Solution:
     - Removed `upcomingInstance: billInstances` from all three select statements (lines 31, 45, 59)
     - Upcoming instances are already fetched separately with a proper query (lines 79-98)
     - Query now only selects: bill, category (leftJoin), account (leftJoin)
   - Files updated: app/api/bills/route.ts
   - Result: Bills page now loads successfully without errors
   - Also fixes: Merchant deletion error (was same bills API error)
