COMPLETED BUGS:
✅ 1. the category and accounts dropdown on the bill form are not connected to the categories and accounts
✅ 2. when creating a new transaction the default date should be today
✅ 3. There should be a way to mark an account as being a Business Account and that should trigger the sales tax tracking for that account.
✅ 4. If there are multiple business accounts the sales tax should be tracked separately.
✅ 5. Everywhere that you can add a category or tag there should be an option to create them inline.
✅ 6. there should be some padding in between the sidebar and the page content. The dashboard is a good example of the amount of padding it should have. Check all of the pages and ensure the padding is like the dashboard page.
✅ 7. When trying to create an account the submit button is not creating the account.
✅ 8. the dropdowns across the app are completely transparent, turn up the opacity so that they can be read easier.
✅ 9. when creating a transaction there should only be a transfer type instead of transfer in and transfer out. If Transfer is selected it should show a From Account and To Account dropdowns.
✅ 10. the transaction form is doubled up there should only be one.
✅ 11. make the cards on the categories page more compact.
✅ 12. Account creation was failing with 500 error - fixed missing is_business_account database column
✅ 13. Sidebar dashboard was highlighted even when a different option was selected - fixed isActive() function
✅ 14. Transfer form showed duplicate "Account" labels - fixed by making AccountSelector label customizable
✅ 15. Category cards were too large - made them significantly smaller (p-2, reduced fonts, gap-2)
✅ 16. Categories couldn't be marked as tax deductible - added isTaxDeductible field and toggle UI
✅ 17. BillsWidget error "data.filter is not a function" - API returns {data: [...], total, limit, offset} but component expected array. Fixed by extracting data.data and handling both array and object responses
✅ 18. Added Merchant field to transactions with inline creation feature:
   - Added merchantId field to transactions table in schema
   - Created database migration 0005_add_merchant_id.sql
   - Enhanced /api/merchants/route.ts with POST endpoint for creating merchants
   - Created /api/merchants/[id]/route.ts for PUT (update) and DELETE operations
   - Created MerchantSelector component with inline creation (similar to CategorySelector)
   - Integrated MerchantSelector into TransactionForm (hidden for transfers)
   - Created full Merchants management page at /dashboard/merchants with list, edit, delete, create
   - Added "Merchants" link to sidebar in Tools section
   - Merchants support usage count tracking and are sorted by usage

✅ 19. Separated merchants and description fields:
   - Removed MerchantAutocomplete from description field
   - Description field is now plain Input component
   - Merchant field is selected via separate MerchantSelector component
   - Merchant suggestions no longer appear in description field

✅ 20. Fixed internal server error when selecting description from dropdown:
   - Root cause: MerchantAutocomplete suggestion dropdown was causing errors
   - Solution: Replaced MerchantAutocomplete with plain Input for description

✅ 21. Added merchant and transfer information to transaction table display:
   - Shows merchant name if available
   - For transfers, shows "From Account → To Account" format
   - Added helper functions: getMerchantName, getAccountName, getTransactionDisplay
   - Transfer icon shows ArrowRightLeft in blue color
   - Reduced vertical space: p-4→p-2, space-y-3→space-y-2, removed type badge
   - Transactions now take up ~50% less vertical space

✅ 22. Fixed transaction creation 500 error - merchantId not handled:
   - Root cause: merchantId field added to schema/form but not extracted in API endpoints
   - POST /api/transactions now extracts merchantId from request body
   - PUT /api/transactions/[id] now supports merchantId updates
   - Removed old auto-merchant creation logic (conflicted with new MerchantSelector)
   - Now only tracks merchant usage when merchantId is explicitly provided
   - Updated validation to check for merchantId in update checks
