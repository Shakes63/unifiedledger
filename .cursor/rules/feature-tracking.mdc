# Feature Tracking Rules

## docs/features.md

- **New Features section**: Always keep a **"New Features"** section at the very top of `docs/features.md` for quick idea capture.
- **Incomplete tasks**: For any incomplete feature/task:
  - Record **status** (e.g., In progress / Blocked) and what remains unfinished
  - Reference the corresponding implementation plan file path in `docs/` (e.g., `docs/<feature>-plan.md`)
- **Completed features**: When a feature/task is completed:
  - Replace the detailed entry with: **`Feature Name [COMPLETED YYYY-MM-DD] - 1 line summary`**
  - Delete the associated plan file from `docs/`

## Unified Architecture docs

- If a completed feature is part of the **Unified Debt/Bill/Credit Card Architecture**, mark the relevant phase as complete in `docs/unified-debt-bill-credit-card-architecture.md`.

## docs/manual-testing-checklist.md

- When adding or completing a feature, ensure there is a corresponding manual verification item in `docs/manual-testing-checklist.md` (or update an existing section) so functionality can be spot-checked outside automated tests.
