# feature

Review docs/features.md and work through unfinished features in priority order.
Before coding, reuse an existing docs/<feature>-plan.md or create one (steps, edge cases, server/client decision, routing/rendering, theme vars, strict TS).
Implement the next task, add tests, update docs, add a manual check, ensure it builds, then commit.
Only mark complete when tests pass and docs are updated.
